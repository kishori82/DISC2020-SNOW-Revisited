	Abstract = {We consider the problem of providing byzantine-tolerant storage in
	distributed systems where client-server links are much thinner and
	slower than server-server links. We provide storage algorithms that
	are unique in two ways. First, our algorithms take into consideration
	the asymmetry in network connectivity by minimizing client-server
	communication. To provide this property, we rely on a small amount
	of partial (eventual) synchrony. Second, our algorithms provide a
	new property called limited effect, which is important for storage
	systems. To provide the latter property, we use synchronized clocks,
	which are increasingly common due to GPS devices and NTP, even in
	otherwise "asynchronous systems" like the Internet. We present two
	algorithms called QUAD and LINEAR, which provide a trade-off between
	failure resiliency and efficiency. Our algorithms implement an abortable
	register [3], which is an abstraction used in some real storage systems,
	but abortable registers are weaker than atomic registers. Thus, one
	might wonder if we could have implemented atomic registers instead.
	We answer this question in the negative: we prove that there are
	no implementations of atomic registers that provide the limited effect
	property in systems with failures, even with synchronized clocks.},
