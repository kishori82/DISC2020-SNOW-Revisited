The SNOW work~\cite{SNOW2016} claimed, after examining existing, work there existed only one system, Eiger~\cite{Lloyd:nsdi2013}, whose \rots{} had bounded latency---i.e., non-blocking and finish in three rounds---while providing the strongest guarantees--i.e., having properties W and S---because Eiger claimed that its \rots{} provide strict serializability within a datacenter.
%, even if providing strict serializability was not a focus of Eiger. 
%
In this section, we correct this claim and show there were no existing algorithms that had bounded latency while providing the strongest guarantees by proving Eiger's \rots{} are not strictly serializable. 
%The insight is that Eiger uses logical timestamps to track the ordering of operations while logical clocks are not able to enforce the real-time ordering between operations. Strict serializability, however, requires the real-time ordering to be respected.
